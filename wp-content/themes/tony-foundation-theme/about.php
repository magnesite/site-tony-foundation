				<h1>Tony's Story</h1>

				<p>My name is Tony Laudadio, I am 34, and I have cancer. I was diagnosed on September 24, 2015. I was previously diagnosed with a different primary cancer at age 29, in July of 2013. My first bout was with renal cell carcinoma and a very large tumor. It caused me to lose my right kidney and forced me out of work for half a year. This time around it is brain cancer and completely unrelated to the first one. I thought I was well on my way to recovery and potentially ringing the bell (sort of a fun cancer free ritual they do at MD Anderson) when I unexpectedly had two seizures a week apart and found out about this new diagnosis.</p>

				<p>After my docs determined I had Oligodendroglia Grade 3 Brain cancer, I underwent a successful "awake craniotomy," which is a very specialized and rare surgery. It was about 8-10 hours long and I was awake for most of it. Following that, I underwent 30 days of brain radiation and 14 months of physical therapy and chemotherapy. Currently, my cancer is stable. But the fight we are facing is far from over and it will most likely be one that I battle for a long time.</p>

				<p>I feel like I have a great attitude and I think that is an absolute must. I have kindly been told that I am inspiring and brave and some other qualities, but honestly I am just trying to be like my role models were to me growing up. My grandparents and parents, my 3 siblings, my aunts and uncles, cousins, my close friends are all people that showed me how to get through tough times.</p>

				<p>
					Most important of all, my wife, Carrie, has been my absolute rock through all of this. She was 7 months pregnant when they removed a tumor the size of a butternut squash from my kidney. Two years later, she was 8 months pregnant at MD Anderson when they operated on a large tumor in my brain. Her strength is unfathomable to me. <figure>

					</figure>Anyone who really knows her definitely knows how true this is. She has been with me every step of the way and our love is stronger now than it has ever been. She has been my biggest inspiration every day that we have tried to conquer this journey.</p>

				<p>Finally, I have always loved competition. I treat this experience like an adverse competitive situation, which is never something I have shied away from in the past. Anybody that knows me, knows that I live for those kind of moments. At times, cancer does test my resolve and patience, but I now use such a tough life issue to show my kids, friends, and family how to stare down adversity and continue to tell ‘em to "bring it on.”</p>

				<p>Thanks for reading my story. I hope that it might inspire you, or someone else you may be close with so please share it with others. I also encourage others to reach out for help if you need it.</p>

				<p>Sincerely, <br>Tony Laudadio</p>
